### Brief Description

The project our group has chosen to develop is a **sharing platform for deep learning models**. Our initial idea is to develop a web page with a homepage, 
login interface, user profile interface, and deep learning model interface with basic creation, query, modification, uploading, and commenting functions, 
based on the Github website format. If time and group members' ability level allow, we would like to continue to develop advanced functions 
such as adding co-creators, linking data sources, displaying learning results for the model and so on.

### Motivation

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, an algorithm that uses artificial neural nets as an architecture to learn representations of information. 
In recent years, deep learning has become one of the buzzwords in the field of computing, and this technique has matured with the research, 
moving step by step from theoretical research to everyday use. This fervor culminated in March 2016 when news hit the press that AlphaGo, 
a program developed with deep learning, had beaten the best human players in a tournament for the first time. 
As more and more people became interested in this technology, new frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch were invented, 
making it easier to apply the technology to all walks of life. With the widespread use of this technology in today's society and 
the personal interest of our group members, we came up with the idea of creating a platform for deep learning enthusiasts to store models 
for exchange ideas and sharing experience.

### Features

##### _Core Features_
